This project allows the automatic generation of color-by-number worksheets inspired by the ones from [this website](https://www.coloringsquared.com/). There are two different possibilities:

**Infinite Pokemon generation**:

With just a single click, an imaginary Pokemon image will be generated by an AI system, pixelated, and used to generate the color-by-number worksheet. The drawing is different each time, so you can generate an infinite stream of worksheets.

**Use your own images**:

You can upload your own image and the code will automatically crop a square region in the center of the image, resize it, limit the number of colors to a predefined quantity and create a ready-to-print worksheet.

Note, however, that the input image should already be a pixel-art image. Otherwise, the resulting image will lack any well-defined details.



In both cases, the worksheet can be generated in any of three variants:

- Each cell displays the number of the corresponding color.

- Each cell displays an addition that must be solved to obtain the corresponding color.

- Each cell displays a subtraction that must be solved to obtain the corresponding color.
